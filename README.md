### ðŸ“š "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers

---

#### There are four reasons to change software and each can impact several things in the system.
1. Adding a feature (structure, new functionality)
2. Fixing a bug (structure, existing functionality)
3. Improving the design (structure)
4. Optimising resource usage (resource usage)

Avoiding change ultimately leads to fear and doubt in our ability. To counter this, change needs to be part of our routine.

#### Working with feedback
Changes in a system can be made in two primary ways:
- Edit and Pray
- Cover and Modify

Qualities of good unit tests:
1. They run fast 
2. They help us localize problems

#### The legacy code change algorithm
1. Identify change points.
2. Find test points.
3. Break dependencies
4. Write tests
5. Make change and refactor

#### Sensing and Separation
They are the two reasons to break dependencies 
1. Sensing - we break dependencies to sense when we can't access values our code computes
2. Separation - we break dependencies to separate when we can't event get a piece of code into a test harness to run

#### The Seam Model
A seam is a place where we can alter behavior in the program without editing in that place.
The enabling point - every seam has one and it's a place where we can make the decision to use one behavior or another.

method/object(seam), argument list (enabling point)

In general, in OOP, object seams are the best choice

Refactoring is a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its existing behaviour.
